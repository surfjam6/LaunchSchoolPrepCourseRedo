## Exercise 10

# hash with array for values:
## hash = {bob: ["160lbs", "6 ft", "brown"], mary: ["110lbs","5 ft", "blond"]}

# array with hashes:
array = [{bob: 23}, {mary: 20}, {george: 50}]

#Exercise 11:
# I like http://docs.rubydocs.org/ because it's easy to read and searchable per version
# For Rails I like the way http://api.rubyonrails.org/ is organized
